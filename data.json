The thunder shook trees ten times your size almost to their core, rain pelting down at incredible speeds, and your body and fur is soaked to it's core, causing you to shiver inexplicably, and without any warning every few seconds. \r\nOf course, you knew you should be inside; that would be any reasonable person's first thought. However, when your \"home\" consisted of a cave that tended to flood easily.. you were out of luck when it come to torrential downpours such as today. Seeking refuge, you set out from your little hidden home in Green Hill towards a more mechanical zone; Metallic Madness. The actual place didn't even sound like a real zone, but it apparently existed given you were standing on it's grounds, slick with rain as you leaned back against a wall underneath a particularly large translucent pipe, finding a place to rest, atleast for now.\r\nYou sigh in relief, flicking your long tail and using the claws he had given you to wipe some of the water off; albeit, not much."

It's about 2:34AM currently, nobody should be awake, yet you know who is. You hear her LAUGHTER from the other room, along with the sound of liquid pouring. She's slurring a little, clearly DRUNK, and the smell of hard liquor carries in the air.\r\nSomething is playing, a VOD from one of your streams, probably. You hear your own voice played back at you, though you can't pinpoint the one it's from. You're also too exhausted to question it further. Your boots clack against the wooden floor as you SLAM the front door and approach, not bothering to lock it behind you.\r\nJASON: Karina.\r\nJASON: It's-\r\nKARINA: Yeaah, yeah. It's- It's fuckin'. Yeah.\r\nJASON: ..\r\nJASON: Why are you up?\r\nKARINA: Cause!\r\nKARINA: Was fuckin'- waitin' for you, asshole.\r\nYou stare at her for a few moments. She's clearly annoyed, refusing to peel her eyes away from the TV. You shove her aside slightly, causing her to knock you back with an elbow - a common occurrence between you two, and almost a sign of affection at this point - sitting down next to her on the worn couch.\r\nJASON: Sorry.\r\nKARINA: ...\r\nKARINA: Whaatever.\r\nKARINA: I-I do the same-\r\nJASON: Yeah, but you tell me.\r\nJASON: Hell, you give me fucking, hourly updates!\r\nKARINA: I-I can stop if you want me to!\r\nShe sits up instantly, looking over at you with some semblance of fear in her eyes. You grimace at the reaction, causing her to look away with a guilty expression. Old habits die hard on both sides, you guess.\r\nJASON: No, no- You- I like it.\r\nKARINA: What?\r\nJASON: I like it.\r\nShe stares at you, dumbfounded by your rare expression of EMOTION. So you continue.\r\nJASON: I-I don't know, you know the game made me- us. Paranoid.\r\nJASON: Sometimes, well, okay, alot, it's good to know you're. You know.\r\nJASON: Still alive.\r\nJASON: Not-\r\nKARINA: Yeah, I-I get it.\r\nKARINA: I-I mean that's why I'm so-\r\nJASON: Yeah.\r\nJASON: I-I'm sorry, Kar.\r\nJASON: You know I just get-\r\nKARINA: I knoww! I knowww- but-\r\nJASON: Yeah.\r\nJASON: Love you?\r\nKARINA: Hahaa..\r\nKARINA: I love you too, i-idiot.\r\nShe falls back against you, picking up the remote lazily and handing it to you, causing you to promptly switch it to literally anything else. Thankfully, she knows how much you hate watching your own streams.\r\nShe knows almost everything about you."

A possibly fucked one, at that, and you don't like to swear! You have various interests- but they really, really aren't important right now. All you care about is making sure everybody gets to this new world or whatever Jas is fumbling on about- although she does seem to know an awful lot more than usual about this particular thing, almost like she's prepared- SAFE and SOUND!\r\nYou're currently on LOMAL (The Land of Metal and Lights!) which, really is quite pretty if you do have to say so yourself- much like the name implies, is quite the LIGHTSHOW. The sky is a constant dark purple, allowing the yellow-green-blue hues to shine against the background even brighter. The ground consists of, you guessed it, an almost unnaturally jarring metal structures, placed at strange and almost eerie angles, a vast ABYSS awaiting below the miles and miles of shiny tresses, platforms and towering buildings.\r\nYou focus your attention back to JAS, your aforementioned sister, who has.. now seemingly passed out on her bed. You groan loudly, preparing to close the feed overall, and then-\r\n-- wifeBeater [WB] has begun pestering maleWife [MW] at 7:01AM! --\r\nWB: that proof enuf 4 u\r\nMW:\r\nMW:\r\nMW: HOW DID YOU DO THAT?!\r\nWB: do waht\r\nMW: YOU.\r\nMW: YOU'RE ASLEEP!!\r\nWB: ya but not on prospit lol\r\nMW:\r\nMW:\r\nMW: YOU'RE FUCKING KIDDING ME.\r\nWB: dude i told u 4 ytears it was real!\r\nWB: YR the one that never beliueved me\r\nWB: THE WHOLE 'JASSS its just a dreaaam frum when we were kids cmon stuff'\r\nMW: Oh my god..\r\nMW: So that means..?\r\nWB: YEAH IM USULLY RITE LMAO ATLEST ABT THIS STUFF JAZZ\r\nWB:\r\nWB: srry for yelling,. you get my pouint though right????\r\nMW: Yeah.

Your sister and you had once dreamed of Prospit and Derse, talked about each kingdom to concerning lengths at the dinner table (much to your parents' delight) but to believe they were actually REAL was a whole other level- hell, your head felt dizzy from the KNOWLEDGE!\r\nFalling asleep will be easy at this rate, maybe even a welcome relief if she is just going on about utter bullshit yet again. You wearily, and very cautiously flick the small light above you that you had set up a month prior off, settling into the cot you've been sitting in the entire time.\r\nAnd, without any effort, just like predicted you...\r\n..\r\n.\r\nJolt up in an eeriely familiar, yellow tinted bedroom.\r\nJAZZ: What the..\r\nYou look over at the identical, still CAT-COVERED bed a few feet away; empty. You don't know what you expected, it was always empty, but. For some reason, something felt very, very wrong about that. You slowly flick the sheets off of you and clamber out of the bed, swaying side to side as you do.\r\nYour legs feel.. weak, painful, the way they would if you haven't used them for a while. Your nose scrunches up in discomfort, but you don't express it any other way. Looking out the open, nearby window leads you to a vast sight; the whole of Derse in all its amethyst hues and violet glory; black-carapaced citizens lining the streets"

It takes you a long moment to move, and just when you open your mouth to speak, you\u2019re surprised that the first noise made doesn\u2019t come from you.. But him.\r\n\u201c..What are you doing here. I made it clear that I wanted you to stay back at the base.\u201d\r\nHis voice shakes you to your core, cold and mechanical. Just like him. The sentence takes the blue blur and his friends by surprise, noticing Metal\u2019s lack of attention towards them. It makes you sick, but all eyes are on you now. \r\nAmy is the first to speak, \u201cGloom? What are you doing here?! You know it\u2019s not safe!\u201d\r\nHer insisting innocence makes the pit in your stomach fall even more. You don\u2019t respond to her, instead electing to take a step towards Metal, with only an answer for him, your voice shaky.\r\n\u201cSince when do I listen to you..?\u201d\r\nHe can only look over at the onlookers in response, attacks on both sides seemingly halted as Sonic looks between you two, confusion riddling his face. \r\nYou won\u2019t be the first to break it to him, you can\u2019t- but. Metal, with his new found voice, seemingly doesn\u2019t have your restrictions.\r\n\u201cAre you confused, hedgehog? Wondering why one of your so-called allies is seemingly an exception to my rule?\u201d\r\nHis two-tailed fox friend has seemingly already put the pieces together, given the look of betrayal on his face, which isn\u2019t all that surprising to you.. Though, you can\u2019t say you were close with him.\r\n\u201cSonic!\u201d He cries out, in his obnoxious tone, \u201cShe\u2019s.. She\u2019s working with Metal!\u201d\r\nAnd the mechanical laughter fills the air, that voice again making your heart beat against your chest. Yet, your feet lead you toward him, until you\u2019re by his side, his hand on your shoulder, and your eyes directed towards them.\r\n\u201cYes, fox. She is. And has been for quite some time, unbeknownst to you and your group.\u201d\r\nIt takes a heavy toll among the group, somewhat to your surprise. The betrayed look is now shared, and it makes you move closer to the mechanical hedgehog by your side. He continues to speak, to your surprise. Though, you\u2019ve always imagined him to be more of the silent type.. It appears this version of him- if it truly is him- isn\u2019t such the case.\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you seem to care so much about this little experiment. You are all aware of her past. Even the shoes she continues to wear signifies her allegiance to us- Whether you noticed or not, she has been against you this entire time, hedgehog. Who knows how many more of your allies are as well?\u201d\r\nYou try to tune out his mocking words, knowing it\u2019s all for play, yet your eyes eventually avert up to him, just to see the glowing red ones meeting yours. \r\nSonic\u2019s irritating voice interrupts the moment though.\r\n\u201cHah! As if I\u2019d ever believe somethin\u2019 like that-\u201d\r\nHis gaunty lines are cut off by a loud whirring, one you\u2019d recognize all too well. You step even closer to Metal, as he picks you up with one arm, a procedure you\u2019re both too familiar with at this point. Though, his changed stature makes it somewhat strange to you, making sure to hold onto his chest as you both raise up from the ground, the heat of his jets propelling you both upwards.\r\nAs you expect another spiteful remark, only his laughter fills your ears, pulling you closer to the now heating sheening surface. The yells of the ones below slowly fade out, as you both soar upwards towards the sky.\r\nHis laughter stops too, the only noise being that of his jets propelling you both forward. An uneasy silence then plays out for an equally uneasy amount of time.. And yet you still aren\u2019t the first to break that.\r\n\u201cWhy did you follow me?\u201d\r\nHis voice is hard to describe, and the fact he doesn\u2019t look at you while soaring through the air doesn\u2019t help you pinpoint his emotional state.\r\n\u201cWh- Why do you think?? I hear that Sonic and his gang are after you, and there\u2019s some haywire about one of the Emeralds being missing- plus, you just not being all that.. Honest with me, Metal!\u201d\r\nThe laughter returns, making your heart thump even louder. You press the side of your head against his chest, muffling the sound with the ones of his jet engines.\r\n\u201cAnd I have told you to not worry about me, or compromise your position, as you so foolishly just did.\u201d\r\nYou fall silent once again, something he notices as he looks over with those eyes.\r\n\u201cYou dislike this form.\u201d\r\nIt results in a scoff from you, as well as a glare."
